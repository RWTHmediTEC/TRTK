/** \file Version.hpp
  * \brief This file contains some version information of the TRTK library.
  *
  * There might be moments where you need to rely on a certain version of TRTK.
  * To be able to check for a specific version use the following macros:
  *
  * - \ref TRTK_MAJOR_VERSION
  * - \ref TRTK_MINOR_VERSION
  * - \ref TRTK_PATCH_LEVEL
  *
  * If you want to prevent the code from compiling in the case of a differing
  * version (i.e. due to the [rare] case of an API change), you can use some
  * code like this:
  *
  * \code
  * #if (TRTK_MAJOR_VERSION != 1 || TRTK_MINOR_VERSION != 4)
  * #  error "TRTK VERSION 1.4 REQUIRED!"
  * #endif
  * \endcode
  *
  * This code requires a major version of 1 and a minor version of 4. The
  * patch level is ignored (which makes sense, since this is only intended
  * for bug-fix releases).
  *
  * \author Christoph Haenisch
  * \version 0.2.0
  * \date last changed on 2014-07-02
